## Features

### Add Sessions

After getting the form completed, I soon realized that not everyone will fill this out the same way... 
![User Testing](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/user_testing.png)
I need to add a unit dropdown box to give me more control on how the user's input the data. This will allow me to perform unit conversions on the given values.

Now when the user is filling out the form there are a few differnt session types the user can select from. Weightlifting is the only table that requires the user to be able to add and remove rows depending on the amount of exercises the users has proformed. They can also change there mind if they have started filling out the form with the incorrect session type and the form will remove the table incorrectly selected. Running, walking and cycling only require two pieces of information from the user, the unit of the distance travelled and the distance travelled.

### Add record

![add_record_feature](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/add_record_feature.jpg)
Same as the add session form the user can select from four session types: weightlifting, walking, running, cycling the from will change depending on the users selection. 

### Add Training Plan

![training_plan](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/add_trainingplan_feature.jpg)
First the user will need to tell us how many weeks the plan will be created over, then which days will be training days and which will be rest days. After, the user will need to add a name for the plan and then continue to fill out the rest of the training days. The table rows can be scaled up to 100 but that can easily be changed with one variable value but for this web app to save loading speeds this should be more than enough.

When the training plans have been created only the creator of the plan can remove it from the database.

### Settings (convertions)

![settings](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/settings_feature.jpg)
The user is able to change the unit for the distance and the weight, all the sessions, records and details will be updated to the correct unit specified by them.
