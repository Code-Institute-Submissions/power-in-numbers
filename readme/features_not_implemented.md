### Records Best Lifts
When the users goes on to the records page, the top lifts will change randomly to show different strengths and weakness for each user, this should create some diversity on the page. As some users will be using the app for strengths and others for cardio.

### Starting a training plan
![details](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/starting_a_training_plan.jpg)
When on the 'Training plans' page after the user has pressed 'extend' and then 'start plan' they will be taken to the next page that will get them to input their chosen weight. After the user has done this they will then be able to access these plans from their training plans page, the user will be able to click the session day  and be taken to the 'Add Sessions' page with the data prefilled. But the user will still be able to edit these values, just incase they couldn't stick to the plan for some reason.

### After registering
I would like to create a tutioral that the user can follow so they can understand how to user the site.

### Body Weight
Profile:
A section were the user is able to store their bodyweight and track their progression with a line graph.

### Add Sessions
When you keep filling out the form it starts getting a bit repetative, I would like a button to be added on the exercise input so the user has a choose to add a custom input or from a dropdown box.

### Pins Records
On the records page I would like a carasel showing the best records and the users information.

### Track Plans (New Page)
Another page to be able to track your training plans for the last time you started a plan.

### Customer Categories
I would like the user to be able to add a session type and select the table that needs showing for that category. I feel this would attract more users because there not restriced to only pre-set categories.
