### Records Best Lifts
When the users goes on to the records page, the top lifts will change randomly to show different strengths and weakness for each user, this should create some diversity on the page. As some users will be using the app for strengths and others for cardio.

### Starting a training plan
![details](https://github.com/Fordalex/power-in-numbers/blob/master/readme/starting_a_training_plan.jpg)
When on the 'Training plans' page after the user has pressed 'extend' and then 'start plan' they will be taken to the next page that will get them to input their chosen weight. After the user has done this they will then be able to access these plans from their training plans page, the user will be able to click the session day  and be taken to the 'Add Sessions' page with the data prefilled. But the user will still be able to edit these values, just incase they couldn't stick to the plan for some reason.
