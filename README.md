# Power in numbers

This web application was thought of because I'm always trying to find ways to track my training plans and training session, but I always lose track or it takes to long to write up the workout. This will hopefuly save me time, help me be more organized and gain knowledge of others training session for better progression. Also collect an array of training plans from different users.
 
## UX
 
This site is designed for people who like to stay active and need the motivation to keep going, also find new training plans to keep things interesting.

I've tried to do most of the leg work for the user creating an easy and enjoyable experience for the user.
- As a user that's just completed a training session your going to be tried and logging your session should be as quick and easy as possible.
- The stats section on the profile page has been added so the user can watch their progress and easier workout the amount of workouts they have completed. Using d3 and crossfilter the user can see has many sessions they have done for each session type e.g. powerlifting, running...

This project is hosted on heroku [Power-in-numbers](https://power-in-numbers.herokuapp.com/login) Please feel free to create an account and start making progression as soon as possible.

The main theme of the site is blue, while and black. I have created a seamless background image and added this on most pages to make the site feel the same, as the user navigates thoughout. 

## Features

- The first page the user will be faced with is the login page, the user can either create a new account or log in.
- After the user logs in they will be taken to their profile, if the user has just created the profile.
- User's can log a training session, personal record and training plans from their profile page.
- The home page has an array of filters, so depending on the users goals they can see a collection of the session types, length and date they are interested in.
- Record page will hold all the users personal records and also a filter function to help the user find the content they are after.
- A settings page to change the weight/distance unit to fit different user types. 
 
### Existing Feature
- I would like to create a tutioral that the user can follow so they can understand how to user the site.
